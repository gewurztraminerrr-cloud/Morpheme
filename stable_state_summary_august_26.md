## 2. Key Features, Improvements & Fixes in This Stable State

### A. Lobby Live Player Count Accuracy & Accumulative Room Sync (`app.py`, `game_room.py`, `static/js/lobby.js`, `templates/index.html`)
- **Guest Session Auto-Initialization Hardening**:
  - `ensure_guest_session()` and `guest_login()` now incorporate a collision retry loop (up to 10 attempts), preventing random `UNIQUE constraint failed: users.username` errors in SQLite from leaving guest users unauthenticated.
- **Backend Room Wake-Up & State Machine Fixes**:
  - Corrected `check_and_update_state()` in `game_room.py` to reference `wc_label` instead of undefined `wc_lbl` when waking up paused rooms upon human player join.
  - Corrected `_bg` board generator reference in `game_room.py` watchdog fallback.
- **Lobby Stats Aggregation**:
  - `get_lobby_stats()` in `app.py` aggregates human player counts accurately across all game configurations, including 24-hour daily persistent archives in `past_players` and active participants within 60 seconds in real-time rooms.
- **Frontend Button State Preservation & Hydration**:
  - Guarded `fetchAndRenderRooms` in `lobby.js` and `index.html` so non-accumulative room list updates never overwrite `Start [N]` player counts on Accumulative buttons.
  - Added early stats hydration listeners on `DOMContentLoaded` and fallback defaults for `updateLobbyButtons()`.
  - Bumped `lobby.js` cache-buster version to `v=33189`.

### B. New FAQ Entry for Game Room Window Navigation (`templates/index.html`)
- **Quick Navigate & Detailed FAQ**:
  - Added quick navigate button and accordion entry in the **How to Play & FAQ** modal:
    - **Question**: *It's difficult to slide over to neighboring windows in game rooms. Is there an easier way to do this?*
    - **Answer**: *The grey bar along the bottom not only is pressable, but swipeable as well. Get into the habit of swiping across or pressing on the text on it and the navigation eventually becomes instinctual!*

### C. Real-Time Timeout Countdown & Expiration Handling (`app.py`, `static/js/app.js`, `static/js/play.js`, `static/js/lobby.js`)
- **Dynamic Real-Time Countdown**:
  - Timeout modal updates remaining time second-by-second in real-time without requiring a page reload or app restart.
  - Automatically unblocks and returns the user to the Lobby or Active Room seamlessly the instant the timeout duration expires.
- **Moderation & Private Messaging Enforcement**:
  - Timed-out users are strictly prevented from sending private messages, creating rooms, or entering matchmaking queues until the timeout period has lapsed.

### D. User Profile & Interface Polishing (`static/js/profile.js`, `static/css/style.css`)
- **Profile Search Transition**:
  - Eliminated previous user profile layout flash on new profile searches.
  - Constrained "About Me" custom scrollbar thumb height strictly within its track boundary.

## 3. Verification & Server Health

* **Localhost Status**: Fully working, all syntax and integration tests passing.
* **Production Deployment (`morpheme.games`)**:
  - PM2 Process `morpheme` (ID 0) online with `0%` CPU and healthy memory.
  - Multi-user live integration tests passed verifying immediate reflection of `Start [1]` and clean reset to `Start [0]`.
  - Zero open unclosed database locks or runtime exceptions in logs.
